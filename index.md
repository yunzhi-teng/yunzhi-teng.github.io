## About me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born in Zibo, Shandong, China in 1997. I received Bachelor degree in Automation at USTB(University of Science and Technology Beijing) in 2019. I also worked in Sensetime as a research intern from December, 2018. 

## Recently
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am working on deployment of deeplearning in Sensetime Research (intern), which combines system and deeplearning, and **[3D vision](https://github.com/yunzhi-teng/CNSLAM)** during other time. 

## previous undergraduate projects (selected)
### 1. Balanced Lane-tracking Car
-	Two wheel standing balanced car
-	Vison based lane-tracking
-	Key words: sobel operator, image process, feedback control, six-axis gyro and signal fusion

### 2. "Back to Your Position" System
-	An no motor vehicle moved by wind which is produced by two motor fans. 
-	Feedback control with motor fan as activator and ultrasonic sensor signal as feedback signal. Control goal is to make the vehicle stop on a given position.

### 3. Monopoly game

### 4. Buzzer Can Sing
-  It is 《Cannon in D》 by Pachelbel performed via a buzzer by controlling its frequency using PWM. (The most interesting part)  
-    Actually, as you can see, this is a intelligent watering system with MCU controled electromagnetic valve. It has sensors to abtain the temperature and humidity of the soil in order to determine when to water. It also can communicate with smart phone using bluetooth to send the data and receive commands.
